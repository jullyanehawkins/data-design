			<p>Jully is an almost 30 years old woman üëµüèª who loves movies. Because of her OCD, she enjoys rating the movies that she watched. One way that she finds to do so is by using the website https://filmow.com/ with her MacBook (macOS High Sierra 10.13.4) and on her iPhone X (iOS 11.3). As a Millennial, she is very confident with technology.</p>
